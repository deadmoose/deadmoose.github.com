Been thinking about giving the whole blogging thing another spin for a while,
so here goes.

For those interested in the gritty details, I played around with setting 
something up with [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) for a bit, but wasn't
too wild about things after beating my head against styling. I could always
punt that frilly stuff, but it was all a bit offputting.

So digging around some more, I found 
[Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll). Years ago, I'd played around with
a similar concept with some python scripts generating static pages from files
in SVN. It's 2011, so other tech is the new hotness.

This also does wacky stuff with automagically hosting things for me; this is 
all checked into git and when I push to [Github](http://github.com), they run 
the converter and host the files up there. A little bit of CNAME magic and
poof. (That last bit is untested as of the 3 am posting here since my DNS
updates are slowly percolating around the intarwebs. Hopefully during the
day, that'll all finish sorting itself out.)

After screwing around a bunch with all this and realizing just how rusty my
CSS is, here we are with something vaguely acceptable. There's work to be done,
but this is at least a bit prettier and more functional than the more basic
Jekyll bits I stumbled across. If anybody in the non-existant peanut gallery
there is more confident with things and wants to volunteer some time to help
me nail some more of this down, drop me a line.

**Update:** Yep, looks like things have drifted around and it's all working.
Hooray! Now to churn out some actual content...
