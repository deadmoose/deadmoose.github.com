Dusting this off for a build journal about my latest project: restoring a 1975 Starcraft Galaxy 8.

Background
----------

For a while now, I've been planning to build a
[teardrop camper](http://tnttt.com/viewtopic.php?f=62&t=49150). I've got two boys, 4 & 1.5, and we
plan to eventually go around to national parks, etc. It'll take some time, but it's also a while
before we're really willing to be on the road that long and try to really camp out with the kids.

To that end, I've been keeping tabs on Craigslist, watching in case anything useful popped up. In
particular, I'd been watching for a trailer base to build off; I could do the whole thing from the
ground up, but avoiding the cost and effort of welding all that together would be handy.

A posting cropped up for a [1975 Starcraft Galaxy 8](http://www.robertssales.com/archives/brochures/1975_starcraft_brochure.pdf)
for just $100. I didn't save a copy of the posting, but it sounded like a mixed bag: mostly intact,
but some water damage to the roof, etc. I figured at that price, though, there'd be at least some
bits to salvage; the dimensions were roughly what I wanted for my teardrop, so even throwing
everything else away would give me that.

I sent email asking a few questions about it, but the post was gone without a reply the next day. I
assumed someone else had just jumped on it, and went back to the search. But another day later, I
got a reply, and next thing I know, I'm 8 miles from home getting a tour of the trailer.

The Trailer
-----------

This was the second owner, and he'd bought it 2002. He did the national parks with *his* kids, but
realized it had sat unused for two years now that they were grown. He'd tried to just donate it,
but couldn't given the rough shape, so he listed it super cheap to let it go.

All in all, it's in great shape: the canvas is fantastic, the pieces are all there, and it all
works. The ceiling leaked around the roof vent and needs replacing, the frame has some rust
(including the ball coupler being a bit tough to use), and there was some closed-up funk that aired
out quickly.

The most pressing issue is the water damage and little bit of mold on the ceiling, but aside from
that, it's perfectly usable. Give everything a good scrubbing, and I could hit a campground with it
today.

Given that, and it's fantastic 70's styling, the plan's changed; instead of scrapping it to build a
teardrop from scratch, I'm going to restore it in full 70's glory. I have various photos I need to
collate and publish with this, but in the mean time, you can go to that sales brochure linked at the
top of this post and look at the pictures they used to sell it back in the day. Color coordinated
green linoleum, upholstery, and countertops. It's amazing.

TODO
----

I need to figure out a better way to manage this list, but some of the things I plan to do so far:
  * Scrub, scrub, scrub.
  * Replace the ceiling. It's essentially just 1" styrofoam attached to the exterior skin, so that
    should all get scrapped and cleaned up.
  * Rewire to a 7-pin harness. My truck as both 4 pin & 7 pin connectors, but 7 gives some options;
    it adds reverse lights, electric brakes, and always-on 12 volt power.
  * Add [electric brakes](https://www.etrailer.com/Trailer-Brakes/etrailer/AKEBRK-35-SA.html). It
    has surge brakes, but electric brakes are cheap and better.
  * LEDs for the exterior lights. I need to add reverse lights since I'm adding support, but
    converting everything over will be nice.
  * Replace the cushions. I ordered one mattress from [Foam Factory](http://www.foambymail.com/)
    since they're remarkably inexpensive and get either hot or cold reviews on RV forums. Assuming
    it seems reasonable, I'll need to figure out what exactly to order and cut down to replace the
    various pieces.
  * Replace the upholstery. This is where things get hairy; I love the current stuff, but it's
    showing its age and I'm not sure how well we can clean it. I need to figure out what's
    reasonable material that maintains the 1975 style.
  * Make new curtains. There's track for it, but the original curtains are long gone. Previous owner
    put some hooks in the wall & used random fabric bits for curtains. I want to either salvage or
    replace the tracks, and do something to match the original design. The brochure shows plain
    green, so that's simple.

There's more, but that's a decent starting place for this post. I've started building a shopping
list with all the random bits and bobs that come to mind: jack stands, exotic screwdriver bits,
water pumps, etc.

I've got a giant pile of unorganized photos that I should sort out and post here, and I need to
start nailing down a more concrete task list. Depending, we may try to camp in it at a nearby
spot this summer, or I might go ahead and remove the roof and then take long enough to replace it
that we lose a year. Hard to say today.
